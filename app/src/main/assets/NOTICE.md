# Source and license notices

Droidcast is an unofficial Android adaptation of [Tinycast](https://github.com/abue-ammar/tinycast). It is not affiliated with Tinycast's maintainers or Raycast.

Tinycast Copyright (C) 2026 Abue Ammar. Android implementation and modifications: Droidcast contributors, 2026. The Android implementation, host adapter and publication branding were developed/modified on 2026-10-30. Distributed under the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3 or later; see [LICENSE](LICENSE). There is no warranty.

- The upstream generated Raycast runtime is copied unchanged into `app/src/main/assets/RaycastRuntime.generated.js`.
- Its complete upstream runtime sources, package lock, build instructions, license and exact revision are in [`third_party/tinycast-runtime`](third_party/tinycast-runtime).
- Original Swift visual-reference files and provenance are in [`third_party/tinycast-palette`](third_party/tinycast-palette). The Android palette adapts their design tokens and view structure into Compose; the Swift references are not compiled into the APK.
- The runtime includes React under the MIT license. The React license is retained in `third_party/tinycast-runtime/REACT-LICENSE` and bundled as `app/src/main/assets/REACT-LICENSE`.
- The translucent Android activity interaction was informed by [Launchpad Search](https://github.com/jaxparrow07/launchpad-search); its implementation was not copied.
- Store extensions are downloaded at runtime under their respective licenses. No Store extension bundles are shipped in the APK or this repository.
- The offline emoji data is derived from GitHub's gemoji under its MIT license. The exact source and revision are in `third_party/gemoji`; the full license is bundled as `GEMOJI-LICENSE`. Common text-symbol annotations are authored for Droidcast. Glyph artwork is rendered by the device font.

Android/Compose dependencies and the Gradle wrapper retain their own upstream licenses. No upstream copyright or license notice is replaced by the Droidcast branding.
